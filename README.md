# Commodities_Index_Replication_Strategy
ESILV A4 Project : "Stratégie d’investissement sur les matières premières par réplication indicielle"

## Introduction
This project aims to exploit the correlation between the price of oil (WTI index) and that of American cereals. We constructed a weighted index of four main cereals to simplify data retrieval. After a correlation analysis, we observed an optimal lag of 40 days between the price of oil and that of cereals. Our strategy involves buying the cereal index when the price of oil increases, based on an adjustable indicator. Losses due to data depletion in 2024 were managed by selling portfolio assets. This introduction summarizes our objectives, methods, and key findings.
